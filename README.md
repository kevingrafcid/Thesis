This involves describing the structural, electronic, optical and mechanical properties of the hybrid MoS₂/WS₂ structure.

We construct a 4x4 supercell of MoS₂ in which we replace Mo atoms with W atoms to form substitutions of 6.25%, 
12.5%, 18.75%, 25%, 31.25%, 37.5%, 43.75%, 50%, 56.25%, 62.5%, 68.75%, 75%, 81.25%, 87.5%, and 93.75% to study 
the evolution of MoS₂ properties towards those of WS₂ and obtain the hybrid structure that best exploits the 
properties of both MoS₂ and WS₂.

As a method, we will use DFT, DFT+U, and functionals such as PBE0, HSE06, and SCAN will be tested in this study.

We will use the Quantum ESPRESSO and Thermo_pw packages as software for the calculations.
